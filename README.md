## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael Avrahami, and I'm a soon-to-be graduate from Stuyvesant High School, and incoming freshman to SUNY Binghamton, with an intended major in computer science. 
<br></br>Here is a brief overview of the projects I've worked on so far, coded mostly in HTML/CSS, Python, Java, or C. They generally fall into one of two categories:
<br></br>

#### **School Projects**

These are projects I worked on for classes in school like Systems Level Programming and Cybersecurity, generally with one or two other people. Repositories in this section include:

* [https://github.com/Michael-Av/project02-shell-09-avrahamim-bellowsa-chenm](https://github.com/Michael-Av/project02-shell-09-avrahamim-bellowsa-chenm) - A shell that will execute commands typed in by the user (including redirection) similar to bash or zsh
* [https://github.com/Michael-Av/project03-final-09-avrahamim](https://github.com/Michael-Av/project03-final-09-avrahamim) - A forking server that allows multiple different users on a computer to connect and duel each other in a mental math competition, making use of forks, shared memory, semaphores, and pipes.
* [https://github.com/Michael-Av/final-project-4-casado-victor-avrahami-michael](https://github.com/Michael-Av/final-project-4-casado-victor-avrahami-michael) - A locally runnable simulation of the board game Hive, allowing two users to play the game against each other will all of the game's normal constraints
<br></br>
#### **Personal Projects**

These are projects I worked on in my own time purely for fun, and can range from little dumb ideas to games to astronomy tools and more. Repositories in this section include:

* [https://github.com/Michael-Av/Spherical-Coordinates](https://github.com/Michael-Av/Spherical-Coordinates) - (Ongoing) A program which predicts which stars are visible in the night sky by inputting the user's local time and direction they are facing and translating to absolute stellar coordinates. Stretch goal is to also display other stars nearby in the sky using a matplotlib simulation
* [https://github.com/Michael-Av/boggle-2024](https://github.com/Michael-Av/boggle-2024) - A locally runnable simulation of the word game Boggle which allows the user to play against 1-3 robots of varying difficulties and constrains the user to only legal, playable words
* [https://github.com/Michael-Av/Acrostic](https://github.com/Michael-Av/Acrostic) - A program which allows the user to solve a default acrostic displayed on the screen, flexibly allowing both input to individual clues and to the overall board and adjusting the other automatically. Makes use of animations to satisfyingly draw the board and clues.
